      <h2>Meet The Developer</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! Thanks for stopping by to check out my app! I'm a full stack
        developer who graduated from the Northcoders full-stack JavaScript
        bootcamp in April 2022.
        <br />
        <br />
        This app was built to practise building apps with React as well as
        building attractive UI/UX designs utilising pure CSS. I've borrowed
        icons and colour schemes from my own band's branding to give it a
        unified theme, with the idea being that the icons and colour pallettes
        can easily be swapped out and re-skinned to suit the branding for other
        organisations or personal preferences I choose.
        <br />
        <br />I hope you enjoy using the app as much as I enjoyed building it
        and thanks again for stopping by!
