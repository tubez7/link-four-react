# LinkFour - webgame spike

This project is an attempt to build a connect 4 style browser game as a personal learning exercise. 

It exists to practise and consolidate my prior experience and knowledge of building apps in React, as well as experimenting with new programming concepts, practising UI/UX design ideas utilising CSS etc, and generally playing around with and building upon my knowledge of JavaScript.

If I get a working, functional, and nice looking browser based connect 4 style game working in the process...that will be a nice bonus!
